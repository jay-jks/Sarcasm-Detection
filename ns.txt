Democracy is not just about casting a vote every five years. It's about empowering people to participate in governance.


India is not just a geography or history. It is not only a nation, but a state of mind.



The test of democracy is not the magnificence of buildings or the speed of automobiles or the efficiency of air transportation, but rather the care given to the welfare of all the people.



A true leader is not the one who leads others, but the one who creates leaders among them.



In a democracy, dissent is not only a right, but an essential element.
