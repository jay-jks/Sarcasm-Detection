# Sarcasm Detection with BERT and LSTM

## Overview

This project focuses on building an advanced sarcasm detection system using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, specifically BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The goal is to create a robust system that can accurately identify sarcasm in written text by considering both contextual nuances and sequential dependencies within sentences.
This sarcasm detection project contributes to advancements in sentiment analysis and language understanding, with potential applications in social media analytics, customer feedback analysis, and content moderation across various online platforms.

## Key Components

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a diverse dataset containing examples of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences.

2. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and organize the textual data, preserving contextual and sarcasm-related features.

3. **BERT for Context Understanding:**
   - Utilize pre-trained BERT models to extract contextualized word embeddings.

4. **LSTM for Sequential Understanding:**
   - Implement LSTM neural networks to capture sequential dependencies in the data.

5. **Hybrid Model Integration:**
   - Combine BERT and LSTM outputs to create a comprehensive sarcasm detection model.

6. **Training and Fine-Tuning:**
   - Train the hybrid model using the preprocessed dataset and fine-tune parameters for optimal performance.

7. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Assess model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

8. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the sarcasm detection system for real-time or batch processing of textual data.
